		<h1>My Story</h1>		
		
		<p>Hi Lucinda,</p>

		<p>I made this website to express my deep interest in the Digital Marketing Manager role at Waterloo EDC. I have 10+ years experience shaping engaging digital experiences and would love to guide Waterloo EDC's website strategy, brand, and digital advertising, to attract investment to a region that I am passionate about.</p>

		<p>I bring to the table an understanding of digital marketing ideas and best practices, learned across 6 tech companies (currently at ApplyBoard), as well as a familiarity with the region's ecosystem, having led Velocity's marketing and communications for 3 years. These experiences, combined with creative ideas and a collaborative mindset, would allow me to make a unique impact in this role. I would love to chat more about this opportunity!<p>

		<p>Best regards, <br>Jude</p>

			<p>As Digital Marketing Manager, I led the strategy and execution of digital marketing initiatives at ApplyBoard, the world's largest online platform for international student recruitment, and Canada's fastest-growing tech company. I was responsible for increasing engagement and reach across 7 social media channels, managing our ongoing content calendar, supporting high profile initiatives (resulting in the creation of the company rallying cry, #EducateTheWorld), and using digital advertising to attract new customers and partners. I managed the implementation of the current applyboard.com website to support company and cross-functional needs, involving stakeholder consultations, working with graphic designers and engineering teams, and applying programming skills to ensure a responsive, pixel-perfect implementation.</p>

			<p> I was promoted to Digital Marketing Technologist, leading projects that leverage technology. I managed the creation of assist.applyboard.com, a Zendesk knowledge base, including content mapping, stakeholder consultations, platform design, and technical development. I also managed the creation of applyproof.com, including graphic creation, messaging, Wordpress template development, language translations, maintenance, and security. Additional experiences included website maintenance, UI product alignment, a branding revamp, and accessibility improvements to ensure AODA compliance. Other work includes coding for landing pages, email automation, and liaising with engineering teams to maintain our digital properties.</p>

In addition to building Velocity's brand, initiatives that I implemented led to 20% more students and community participation in events (50+ events and 5,000+ participants/year). I also oversaw 20+ creative mural and physical signage projects.</p>

In addition to participating in activities outside the program, I took on leadership roles such as sitting on the academic appeals committee with senior faculty, acting as a marketing teaching assistant, and working with Queen's Management Consulting Association.
